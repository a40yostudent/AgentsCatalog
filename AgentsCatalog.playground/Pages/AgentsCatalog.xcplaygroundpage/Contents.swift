/*
 Abstract:
 Uses the Agents system in GameplayKit to let the characters in a game move themselves according to high-level goals. This sample demonstrates several of the individual goals that an agent can perform, such as moving to a target, avoiding obstacles, and following a predefined path. AgentsCatalog also shows how to tie multiple goals together to create more complex behaviors, such as making a group of agents seek a common target while moving together as a flock.
