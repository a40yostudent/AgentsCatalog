No optimization or refactor was done on this project to mantain readability and with the intent to let the reader follow both project while practicing.

I'm preparing a refactoring of this project in a more "Swifty" way in which I'll use also all the improvement were added to GameplayKit since 2015.

This is only intended for sharing knowledge, and it is a learning exercise. Use it with respect of the owner of the rights on the original project and always verify the code you run on your computer.
